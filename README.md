# Spoke Reporting
SQL scripts to pull text metrics by user or campaign from [Spoke](https://opensource.moveon.org) databases for external reporting and dashboards.

__Note:__ These scripts require access to a SQL mirror of your Spoke data. They were written for PostgreSQL and may need to be modified for other databases.
